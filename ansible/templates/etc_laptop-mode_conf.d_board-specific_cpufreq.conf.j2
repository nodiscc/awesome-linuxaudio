# CPU frequency scaling and throttling
# ------------------------------------
#
#__COMMENT Laptop mode tools can automatically adjust your kernel CPU frequency
#__COMMENT settings. This includes upper and lower limits and scaling governors.
#__COMMENT There is also support for CPU throttling, on systems that don't support
#__COMMENT frequency scaling.
#__COMMENT
#__COMMENT This feature only works on 2.6 kernels.
#__COMMENT
#__COMMENT
#__COMMENT IMPORTANT: In versions 1.36 and earlier, these settings were included in the
#__COMMENT main laptop-mode.conf configuration file. If they are still present, they
#__COMMENT overrule the settings in this file. To fix this, simply delete the settings
#__COMMENT from the main config file.

# /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies.
# The "governor" can be any governor installed on your system, this usually
# includes "ondemand", "conservative", and "performance". The
# "IGNORE_NICE_LOAD" setting specifies that background programs that have
# a low priority ("nice level") should not cause the CPU frequency to
# be increased. (You generally want this to be enabled in battery mode.)

# Should laptop mode tools control the CPU throttling? This is only useful
# on processors that don't have frequency scaling.
# (Only works when you have /proc/acpi/processor/CPU*/throttling.)
# 
# This is only useful on older P4 processors that do not support frequency
# scaling. On such processors, this is the only way to reduce power consumption
# but at the cost of higher performance penalty.
#
# Enable this only if you have a processor that does not support frequency scaling
# On most new processors, you might want to disable it.

# in /proc/acpi/processor/CPU*/throttling. Be careful when using "maximum":
# this may be _very_ slow (in fact, with P4s it slows down the processor
# by a factor 8).
