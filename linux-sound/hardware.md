### Hardware + Linux

If you are looking for pro-audio interfaces that will work with Linux your
choices are limited to certain cards from [RME](http://www.rme-audio.com/),
[M-Audio](http://www.m-audio.com/), and
[AudioScience](http://www.audioscience.com/). Common desktop sound & MIDI
needs are well-served by the **Audigy** and **SBLive!** soundcards from
[Creative Labs](http://www.creative.com). USB audio and MIDI interfaces known
to work under Linux include devices from **M-Audio** ,
[Edirol/Roland](http://www.edirol.com), and [Tascam](http://www.tascam.com).
Linux-compatible PCMCIA digital audio interfaces are available from
[CoreSound](http://www.core-sound.com) (also for some PDAs) and
[Digigram](http://www.digigram.com). If you need a serial port MIDI interface
the [MIDIator](http://www.midiator.com/) enjoys Linux support. Supported
Firewire audio devices are listed at the sites for the
[FFADO](http://www.ffado.org/) and [FreeBoB](http://freebob.sf.net/) projects.
Please consult the [ALSA Supported Soundcards](http://www.alsa-
project.org/alsa-doc/) page for current information regarding ALSA drivers for
specific devices. See also the free [OSS/Linux](http://www.4front-tech.com/)
package from 4Front Technologies, it may support devices not currently
supported by ALSA. Readers are also well-advised to search the archives of the
[Linux Audio Users](http://lad.linuxaudio.org/subscribe/lau.html) mail-list
for reports and evaluations from the field.
