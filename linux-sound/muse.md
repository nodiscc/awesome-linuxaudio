#### Musings April 2009

Still on hiatus here, but I have done some updating and housecleaning. The
logos page has been purged of non-functioning entries, I've added one or two
new images, and few new items have been added to the pages. However, as I'm
not yet actively upgrading the site a more up-to-date database of Linux sound
and music software can be found at
[apps.linuxaudio.org](http://apps.linuxaudio.org/). You can also find hidden
treasures tucked away in the [LAA
archive](http://lad.linuxaudio.org/archive/laa.html), where LAA = the Linux
Audio Announce mail list.

I continue to cover the Linux sound & music software scene in my column for
[LinuxJournal.com](http://www.linuxjournal.com/). I post new articles twice
per month, and links to my previously published work for LJ can be found on
the [DP Track](http://www.linuxjournal.com/user/800764/track) pages.

NB: I do intend to revamp this site. At this time I'm considering the removal
of the least active pages and the consolidation of the remaining material into
a combined apps list and mini-tutorial on using Linux for audio production.
Alas, my current schedule forbids any prediction when, but I hope to get some
of the changes made before the end of Summer 2009.
